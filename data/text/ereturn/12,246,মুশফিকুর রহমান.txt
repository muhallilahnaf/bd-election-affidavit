Texeble income = Tk 1,056,847
Break into slabs:
1. First 350,000 —+ taxed at 0% = Tk 0
2. Next 400,000 (from 350,001 to 450,000) + 5% =Tk 5,000
3, Next 300,000 (450,001 to 750,000) + 10% = Tk 30,000
4. Next 306,847 (750,001 to 1,056,847) + 15% = Tk 46,027.05

So total tax =
5,000 + 30,000 + 46,027.05 = ~Tk 81,027

Car Tax Payment Taka (1,25,000+6,9 52)= 1,31,952
